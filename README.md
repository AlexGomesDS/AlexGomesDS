### Projects
#### E-bikes [https://github.com/AlexGomesDS/lisbon-ebike](Lisbon_e-bikes_usage_insights)
During a month-long period, I monitored the usage of publicly available Gira e-bikes throughout Lisbon by regularly querying their API for bike availability data at various collection points across the city. 
Using Jupyter notebooks, I analyzed the collected data, generated forecasts, and extracted insights. 
An interesting one was the clear identification of a migration of bikes from the outskirts and areas near train stations towards the city center in the morning, and vice versa in the evening.

Status: 🚧 ongoing
